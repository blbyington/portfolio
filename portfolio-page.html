  <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
  <h4>Semantic Tags</h4>

    <p>This is the first assignment we completed for this class.</p>
    <p>What I felt went wrong with this assignment was uploading it to Pages, but it turns out that wasn't necessary to do, but it was a good to learn and I got a lot of experience working with uploading

    <p>Learning how to properly style the CCS codes was tiresome but exciting at same time. It's very fun putting life into my work and messing wit the style. I'm going to think of some better layout ideas and come up with a solid design this week since I know more now and can plan for it.</p>
